node app.js ->
    start script ->
        Parse Code, Register Variables & Functions
              -> Event Loop (Keeps on running as long as there are event listners registered)

The Node uses single thread.

To Exit from the loop : 
    process.exit()


Event Loop:
 -> handle all event callbacks
 -> Executes:
    1. Timers: setTimeOut, setInterval Callbacks
    2. Pending Callbacks: I/O-related Callbacks that were deferred   (I/o -> Disk/file & Network operations ~Blocking Operations)
    3. Poll: Retrieve new I/O events, execute their callbacks
    4. Check: Execute setImmediate() callbacks
    5. Close Callbacks: Execute all 'close' event callbacks
